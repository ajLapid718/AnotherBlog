# README

Notes to self:

This project helped me become more comfortable with MVC architecture, nested routes, and polymorphic associations.

Working on this project helped me recognize how to better handle certain errors and how to better systematically debug.

This time around, I found it useful to write ideas down on a sheet of paper. This sort of served as a pseudo-UML. Other techniques that helped me through hurdles include: the Rubber Duck Method and the Pomodoro Technique.

I ran into a silent bug on this project that had to do with HTML and it was a hard-hitting reminder to be as descriptive as I can be with my commit messages and to commit more often than usual.

I feel more comfortable with model-level validations and database-level validations and I came across certain SO posts that reminded me what was deprecated from Rails version to Rails version (for example: attr_accessible in Rails 4 and strong parameters in Rails 5).

I ensured that the dependent destroy property worked by verifying in the Rails Console.

Learned a lot more about styling. Learned more about the pluralize method as well as time-related methods. Improved upon version control and going from the development environment to the production environment. Became more comfortable with altering the schema with add_column and remove_column calls as well as the rollback method in the terminal.

Pretty happy with the case-insensitive search bar, the pagination, the tagging, the slight FB-look-alike log in, and implementing partials.

I made an attempt at allowing replies to the comments and then having them be denoted by either being a list element of the parent comment or by styling them to be to the left of the margin, but I started to feel myself pushing my limits on that one both in functionality and in appearance. I will make sure to figure that out in time, but for now, I am content with what I learned and with what I experienced. What I know, what I can implement, and my thinking/planning process have all benefited from this.

Most importantly, I had a lot of fun considering the UI/UX of a blog user. This brought me back to my own blogging days and made me appreciate user-friendly layouts and organization. Seeing things from this side of the application was humbling in its own right.
